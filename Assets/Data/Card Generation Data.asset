  cardDescriptions:
  - The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say. The manager of the fruit
    stand always sat and only sold vegetables.
  - It turns out you don't need all that stuff you insisted you did. The tattered
    work gloves speak of the many hours of hard labor he endured throughout his life.
  - He's in a boy band which doesn't make much sense for a snake. She advised him
    to come back at once.
  - Eating eggs on Thursday for choir practice was recommended. Nobody has encountered
    an explosive daisy and lived to tell the tale.
  - The shark-infested South Pine channel was the only way in or out. She let the
    balloon float up into the air with her hopes and dreams.
